      <h2>Important Golf Terms</h2>
       <div id="special">
          <p>These are the basic course, gameplay, and scoring terms you'll here on the course or when talking about golf. There are several more than what is listed here so don't be surprised if you here something else. Golf is meant to be fun so some of these terms may seem clever or even strange. If you hear someone say "handicap" they're referring to the average strokes a player hits over par. It'll sound like, "What's your handicap?" A player would respond with a number. Scratch golfers are able to play a course at even par on average.
