      <h2>Golf Equipment</h2>
        <div id="special">
          <p>First time golfers only need the basic equipment. Having the right equipment always helps. Golf can be expensive too. I'd suggest starting with just the basic equipment until you get the hang of things. Check out the information below to help you decide what you're interested in buying to get yourself started.
          </p>

       <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Golf Club Bag: How else will you carry all those clubs?</li>
           <li>Balls: There are several kinds. I'd start cheap. Balls are lost often.</li>
           <li>Clubs: Try renting to start. Your clubs are the most expensive piece of equipment.</li>
           <li>Tees: For use on the tee box with your driver.</li>
           <li>Umberella: You never know when it might start raining. You'll want to stay dry when you can and an umberella will help with that.</li>
           <li>Towel: No, not to dry off. This towel will be used to clean the dirt off your clubs and your balls. We can't have dirty balls on the green.</li>
          </ul>

       <h3>Apparel</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Shirts: Polo's are recommended for men. For women, there are a variety of tops to choose from.</li>
           <li>Shorts, Skirts, or Pants: Professional men play in pants; but you not pro YET. Shorts or skirts are more comfortable in the heat.</li>
           <li>Shoes: Try on golf shoes to find your fit. Remember you'll be wearing these shoes for upwards of 4 hours and walking around A LOT. Also keep in mind that you won't want your feet to slip during your swing.</li>
           <li>Hats or Visors: Help keep the sun our of your eyes when you're watching your ball flight. Headwear is also great for shade over your face and neck.</li>
