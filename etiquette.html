      <h2>Etiquette</h2>
        <div id="special">
          <p>Before hitting the course for your first round of golf I'd suggest learning proper golf etiquette. It's a good idea to have this knowledge before beginning your golf adventure.
          </p>

       <h3>Begin Here</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Arrive early. This will give you time to warm up and be ready. Don't want to hurt yourself on the first hole!</li>
           <li>Practice with each club. Start with your AW or PW and work your way up towards the driver.</li>
           <li>After initial warm up, practice chipping. There's usually a designated area for chipping.</li>
           <li>Lastly, practice your putting. Use the same balls in putting practice that you'll use on the course.</li>
           <li>Don't overdue the warmup. No need to hit hundreds of balls on the range.</li>
           <li>Familiarize yourself with course rules and the scorecard.</li>
           <li>Avoid profanity when grouped with players you don't know.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section> 
       <h3>During Play</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Silence! When other players in your group are hitting it is common courtesy to be quiet.</li>
           <li>Avoid slow play. When it's your turn be ready. Once you address the ball it shouldn't take more than 30 to 45 sec to hit.</li>
           <li>Replace divots. Simple, if you take a chunk of grass out when you swing get it and put it back.</li>
           <li>Rake the bunker after your shot.</li>
           <li>Repair your ball mark on the green. It's difficult to putt if the green is bumpy from ball marks. (ball mark is a small indent from your ball impacting the green)</li>
           <li>Mark your ball with a coin or ball marker while other players are putting.</li>
           <li>Don't walk through fellow players putting lines (the line the player plans the putt their ball on to the hole)</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section> 
       <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>HAVE FUN!!</li>
           <li>Congratualte players for nice shots.</li>
           <li>If you're unsure about something just ask. Most players are polite and are out to have fun. I've never met an unhelpful player.</li>
           <li>Yell "FORE" immediately if your ball has a chance of hitting someone.</li>
           <li>Be Polite. Act as if you're playing with your grandparents at first. This will protect you from offending someone who may be strict on USGA rules.</li>
           <li>At the end of the round shake hands with your fellow players. Thank them for the round.</li>
