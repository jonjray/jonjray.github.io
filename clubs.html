      <h2>Clubs</h2>
      <div id="special">
          <p>Below you'll find a table with a breakdown of commonly used golf clubs. Take your time to familiarize yourself with each club. You'll notice the higher the number the shorter you'll hit the ball with it. The club consists of three components; the head, the shaft, and the grip. Keep in mind there are many different club set ups to maximize a players abilities based on their swing.  
          </p>
      </div>
      <section>
       <h3>Woods</h3>
        <p>
          Woods are used to hit longer distance shots. These clubs have larger heads and longer shafts. The majority of these clubs are used for over 200 yards.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section> 
       <h3>Irons</h3>
          <p>
            The irons are the most used clubs. The closer to the green, the higher the numbered iron you'll use. Most golfers carry a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 iron. The lower numbered irons are less forgiving and harder to hit because the loft is less. As a beginner, if you struggle hitting lower numbered irons you could consider replacing them with higher numbered woods or a hybrid (combo club with a wood head design and an iron length shaft).
          </p>
      </section>
      <section> 
       <h3>Wedges</h3>
          <p>
            Wedges are similar to irons. These clubs are great for when a players distance to the green is less than 120 yards. Like the standard irons, most golfers carry multiple wedges with different lofts. Wedges are great for shots around the green that require touch and finesse.
