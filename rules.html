      <h2>Basic Rules of Golf</h2>
        <div id="special">
          <p>The object of the game is to get your golf ball into the hole on the green by hitting it the least number of times. The lower the score the better. Each player can choose whichever club they want to use. Each hole has a "par" score. For example, if you're on a hole and it's a par 4, the goal is to get your ball in the hole in 4 strokes or less.
          </p>

       <h3>Clubs & Balls</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>The maximum number of clubs you can carry is 14.</li>
           <li>You can choose any combination of clubs you want to carry.</li>
           <li>Unless you lose your ball, you must finish each hole with the same ball you started with.</li>
           <li>If you lose your ball during a hole you are allowed to use another as the new ball in play for that hole.</li>
           <li>The ball used can be marked or drawn on to differentiate it from opponents balls.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section> 
       <h3>During Play</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Each hole has a tee box and green.</li>
           <li>Every player starts at the tee box.</li>
           <li>You must hit the ball with one swing. No 'scooping' or pushing the ball with the club.</li>
           <li>Do not hit a ball until it is done moving.</li>
           <li>The player furthest from the hole usually plays first.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section> 
       <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Each course has an assigned stroke number known as par.</li>
           <li>Par repressents the score for a 0 handicap golfer.</li>
           <li>Each hole has its own par score. The sum of all holes is the courses par.</li>
           <li>Par for the majority of 18 hole golf courses ranges from 70 to 72.</li>
           <li>Each shot counts as one stroke.</li>
           <li>If a ball is lost or out of bounds it counts as one stroke, plus another stroke to place a new ball down.</li>
          </ul>
